Features for theS Space Startup App

Space Planet Predictor





Exoplanet Discovery Tool: Utilizes real-time data from NASA Exoplanet Archive to predict and display potential habitable exoplanets based on user-defined parameters like size, temperature, and orbital period.



Habitability Score: Calculates a habitability index for each planet, factoring in stellar type, distance from the star, and atmospheric composition estimates.



3D Orbital Simulation: Visualizes predicted planetary orbits with interactive time controls, allowing users to fast-forward or rewind to see orbital patterns and conjunctions.



Augmented Reality (AR) Sky Scanner: Points the device at the sky to locate the star system of predicted exoplanets, overlaying data like distance and planet details in real-time.

Animated Stylish Fully Functional Space-Related Calculators





Orbital Mechanics Calculator: Computes escape velocity, orbital period, and transfer orbits (e.g., Hohmann transfer) with animated visualizations of satellite or spacecraft trajectories around planets or moons.



Rocket Fuel Efficiency Simulator: Allows users to input rocket parameters (mass, thrust, specific impulse) to calculate delta-V and fuel requirements, with sleek animations showing fuel burn and trajectory changes.



Stellar Lifecycle Estimator: Predicts a starâ€™s lifespan and evolutionary stages based on its mass and spectral type, displaying an animated timeline from main sequence to supernova or white dwarf.



Gravity Well Visualizer: Interactive tool to calculate and animate gravitational forces between celestial bodies, showing Lagrange points and stable orbits with vibrant, user-friendly graphics.



Radiation Exposure Calculator: Estimates radiation doses for missions to specific planets or orbits, with animated charts comparing shielding requirements and exposure risks.

Best UI Design





Cosmic Theme with Parallax Effects: A sleek, dark-mode interface with subtle parallax animations of stars, planets, and nebulae as users scroll, creating an immersive space odyssey feel.



Gesture-Based Navigation: Intuitive swipe and pinch gestures for zooming into 3D models, rotating orbital paths, or panning across star charts, ensuring smooth and engaging interactions.



Customizable Dashboards: Users can pin favorite tools (e.g., planet predictor, calculators) to a personalized home screen with modular, drag-and-drop widgets for quick access.



Micro-Interactions and Animations: Subtle animations for button presses, loading screens (e.g., spinning pulsars), and transitions, enhancing responsiveness and visual appeal.



Accessibility Features: High-contrast mode, scalable text, and voice-over support for all tools, ensuring inclusivity for users with visual or motor impairments.
